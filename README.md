## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Modern urban and industrial environments require mobile robots capable of making real-time decisions to navigate tight and unpredictable spaces. In such scenarios, robots must operate independently with minimal human control, particularly in delivery, inspection, and search-and-rescue missions.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution: The EV3 Autonomous Explorer

Our proposed solution is a compact, sensor-equipped robot built using LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 that autonomously navigates spaces using ultrasonic sensors and logical programming. The robot avoids obstacles, adjusts to environmental feedback, and can be modified for specific mission tasks â€” simulating a basic real-world autonomous service robot.

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Overview

| Component              | Quantity | Purpose                               |
|------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| EV3 Intelligent Brick  | 1        | Central processing & control unit      |
| Large Motors           | 2        | Drive movement (forward/backward)      |
| Medium Motor           | 1        | Steering / mechanism control           |
| Ultrasonic Sensors     | 2        | Front and side obstacle detection      |
| LEGO Technic Parts     | Various  | Structural support and sensor mounts   |

Sensor Placement:
- **Front Sensor**: Detects obstacles directly ahead.
- **Side Sensor**: Measures lateral distance for wall-following or object scanning.

## ðŸ’» Programming Strategy

**Tool Used:** LEGO Education EV3 Classroom (Block-based Programming)

**Main Features:**
- Sensor-driven loops and conditionals
- Distance-based obstacle avoidance
- Steering control using the medium motor
- Continuous scanning for dynamic reactivity

**Logic Flow:**
1. Initialize sensors and motors
2. Begin forward motion
3. Use front sensor to avoid forward collisions
4. Use side sensor to maintain side clearance
5. Activate medium motor to steer or trigger a mechanism as needed

## ðŸ§  Innovation & Impact

- **Accessibility:** Built using accessible LEGO parts and block programming, making robotics approachable for students.
- **Real-world Connection:** Mimics essential functions of autonomous delivery robots or inspection bots.
- **Education-Focused:** Promotes critical thinking, logical reasoning, and hands-on STEM learning.
- **Scalability:** The same architecture can be enhanced for more advanced missions (line following, object handling, communication).

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Add **color or gyro sensors** for improved precision and orientation tracking.
- Design a **modular tool system** for different missions (e.g., package handling).
- Integrate **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi** to allow remote control or telemetry.
- Program a **mission planner** using condition-based tasks.
